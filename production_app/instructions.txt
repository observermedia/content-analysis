Use case:
	Run topic model -> generate probabilistic distribution of current taxonomy 

Requirements:
	Python 
	R
	All .xml files in subdirectory under analysis should be in one directory named “recent_data”
	mystops.csv must be contained in directory with .sh script (mystops.csv can be found on google drive)

Command line arguments:
	(edit these in .sh folder (before executing)
	Path to directory containing xml files (python)
	Number of topics hyperparameter for LDA (R)
	
Data workflow:
	Scrap info from multiple raw xml files (python)
	Save cleaned xml info to single json in current directory  (python)
	Load and preprocessing json file (R)
	Run topic modeling algorithm (R)
	generate .csv and visual output in topic_model_output sub-directory (R)

example command for .sh script:
	python data_extract.py /Users/Clark/Desktop/production_testing/recent_data
